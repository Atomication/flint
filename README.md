### Philosophy

If you want people to use and contribute to your project, you need to start by
answering their most basic questions. Flint is a command line script that will
check your project for common answers to these questions.

#### What is this?

Since it is so important, GitHub founder [Tom Preston-Werner][mojombo]
suggests you [should write the README before you write a single line of
code][RDD]. A well crafted README includes:

- A description of problems your project solves.
- The philosophy behind your project.
- Basic usage and getting started instructions.
- A list of comparable projects that inspired yours or would be suitable
  alternatives.

#### How am I allowed to use it?

Providing the source to your project isn't enough. While you don't _have to_
provide a license, doing so will make it clear to users and potential
contributors how they can legally use your software and what happens to
contributions they make. [Choose A License][choose] can help you pick the right
license for your project.

#### How do I contribute?

You'll want to tell folks about your development workflow so they'll know how
to submit patches for bugfixes and new features. When you add [CONTRIBUTING
guidelines][contributing] to your project, GitHub will make those available at
the top of every new Pull Request screen.

#### How do I get up and running in development?

A bootstrap script is a thoughtful way to let new users (and future versions of
yourself on new hardware) get up and running quickly. A good bootstrap script
detects and installs all project dependencies. Don't make your less technical
users learn devops. Make it as easy as running `script/bootstrap`.

#### How do I make sure my new features didn't break old functionality?

Good software projects have test suites that ensure the code works as
advertised. Even within language communities, there can be a myriad of test
frameworks. You can make it easy to run the test suite with a platform agnostic
`script/test` executable.
